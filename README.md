# SkyRun
 
An open source game made for JPTC october "game jam"-like challenge.

## subject 
Speed. Lots of it. ```hopefully```

## The situation
I jumped into this with ambitious plans and some great ideas, at the begging really enjoyed everything, well, **almost** everything.
Later I realized that this, *game dev* thing is not quite for me, at least when I'm basically solo.
Soon after, due to the loss of motivation, I stopped working on this. Mid-way through the free gamedev course I had already realized it's not quite my thing(at least not when I'm soloing this), from there on the goal was to get the diploma and *probably* later return to all this.

So here I(originally we) am with barely anything done.

## The initial idea and plans
### The basic singleplayer idea
Idea of Skyrun was, as the name suggests, running through the skies and doing some parkour.
But not just that some of the ideas were that the clouds or whatever you'd stand on would later fall so you'd  have to be fast and precise, because there would occasionally be some planes trying to hit you with some interesting mechanics, such as getting rid of them by jumping onto them causing them to collide and unexist or riding them. 

### The fancier mutliplayer ideas
Similarly, as the singleplayer idea the was to run through the skies, but there would be different gamemodes, such as
- Some kind coop gamemode: e.g. jumping on a cloud would cause it to go to the *other* universe making the other player a place to stand on
- Fast reaction based gamemode: if one player jumps on a cloud the corresponding cloud for the other player would dissapear, and there would be barrier coming behind you forcing you to keep moving
- 2v2 coop gamemode: A runner and a pilot, the runners job is to reach the finish, the pilot's - to help the runner by shooting down or potentially kamikazeing down obstacles. Could also have some interunivers mechanics.

### Common stuff
1. Speed
2. Some abilities, like, dash or updraft
3. Speed

## The past and future
`Completely unnecessary part`

This *thing* will, most likely, be just forgotten.

I will, for now, focus more on web or full stack development, for which I have at least some motivation
